Samhainn or Samaín is the most important festival of Celtic origin from the pagan period in Europe until its conversion to Christianity.
The night of 31 October to 1 November served as a celebration of the end of the harvest season in Celtic culture 2 and was considered the "Celtic New Year", which began the dark season.
Samaín is both a festival of transition (the passage from one year to another) and of opening to the other world.
The etymology of "Samaín" is Gaelic and means "end of summer".
The beginning of the Celtic New Year commemorated the transition from light (summer) to darkness (winter): a magical moment when, for one night only, the gates of the afterlife were open, and the souls of the departed were able to visit the world of the living.
It was customary that, during the night of O Samaín, the druids would go around the houses asking for food from the inhabitants, in order to honour the souls of the spirits that visited the village during the night.
On the night of O Samaín, tradition dictates that we do everything necessary to be good hosts, in case the spirits decide to visit our house. Thus, the table is not cleared and the fireplace is not turned off, in order to help the ghosts to fight hunger and cold.
To scare away evil spirits is also a task typical of Samaín. To this end, pumpkins are carved into the shape of a skull and a lighted candle is placed inside as a lantern. In addition, the inhabitants of the villages dress up in animal skins and heads, with the intention of misleading these malevolent souls.
There is nothing more risky than opening the door of your house on the night of O Samaín when you hear someone knocking on it from outside. If you agree to do so and it is a fairy, she will bless your home... but if you are unlucky enough to open it for a goblin, she will give you every reason to regret your decision.
During O Samaín, people wear necklaces made of chestnuts to ward off evil spirits.
